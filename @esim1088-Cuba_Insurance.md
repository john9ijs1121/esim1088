First off, letâ€™s talk about their **mobile cards**. These arenâ€™t your ordinary SIM cards; theyâ€™re designed specifically for Cubaâ€™s unique telecommunications environment. Cuba Insurance offers both prepaid and postpaid options, giving you the flexibility to choose what suits your lifestyle best. Prepaid cards allow you to manage your expenses effectively, ensuring that you only pay for what you use.

The mobile cards come with various data packages, so you can choose the one that fits your internet needsâ€”whether you need a little for social media or a lot for streaming and downloading.

Cuba Insurance also provides international roaming services, allowing you to connect with loved ones back home or access global resources from anywhere in Cuba.

Another great option is the **eSIM**. An eSIM is a digital SIM card that allows you to download your mobile plan directly onto your compatible device. This means no more physical SIM cards to carry around, and you can easily switch between different countries and providers. The eSIM is perfect for travelers who want to avoid the hassle of changing physical SIMs every time they visit a new country. Itâ€™s a modern, convenient, and eco-friendly way to stay connected.
