Many providers now offer online activation options, which make the entire experience smooth and stress-free. Just follow their instructions, enter your details, and voila! Your SIM card is ready to go.

The cost of these SIM cards varies depending on the provider and package you choose. However, most offer competitive pricing considering the unlimited data allowance. Additionally, some providers might bundle other services, such as free calls or texts within the EU, making the deal even sweeter.
